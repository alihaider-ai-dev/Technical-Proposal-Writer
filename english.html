<h1>1. Our Understanding of the Scope of Work</h1>
<h2>1.1 Project Overview</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 Innovation Diwan Program Description</h3>
<p>The Innovation Diwan Program is a unique initiative that follows a crowdsourcing model to generate innovative solutions for local challenges faced by communities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Now in its fourth cohort, the program encompasses four key phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Idea submissions</li>
<li>Bootcamps</li>
<li>Pitching</li>
<li>Solution adoption</li>
</ol>
<p>This comprehensive approach encourages young people to apply their thinking and potentially implement their ideas with adopters and partners.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Program Purpose and Vision</h3>
<p>Purpose: To address community challenges by involving youth in a Solution Design bootcamp and connecting them with sponsors to potentially adopt and implement their solutions.</p>
<p>Vision: Enable the local community and Saudi youth to actively contribute solutions to community challenges in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 Program Mission and Objectives</h3>
<p>Mission: To collect solutions (ideas) from Saudi Youth and organizations to address community challenges and problems. These solutions may provide volunteering opportunities, social enterprises, and/or initiatives.</p>
<p>Objectives:
1. Increase awareness of and involvement in community challenges within Saudi Youth.
2. Crowdsource community ideas to solve prioritized community challenges through an engaging process.
3. Evolve ideas into solutions through a well-structured innovative bootcamp.
4. Showcase best ideas and solution plans to potential sponsors.
5. Develop MVPs for the top 15 solutions to be sponsored.</p>

</ol>
<p>Both stages will utilize design thinking and service design methodologies to develop solutions thoroughly. The bootcamp aims to prepare teams and develop business model canvases and business plans for implementation and adoption.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 Winner Selection</h3>
<p>After the bootcamp, solutions will be presented to a panel of judges. The top 15 teams will win the opportunity to present their ideas to potential adopters.</p>
<h3>1.2.5 MVP Development</h3>
